This is files in order of numbers, still is not completed, but I was received everything i need. Wish that it will be useful for someone. 

There are some basic functionality to find best keywords and research some data of it.

I will try to update it but still have not enough time. Now making some website generator to host own server with crawler support to make a real network with interconnected data that you decide to use by yourself. 

Thank you Yandex team for enoughly pure data for research. Have a good day!

##Short Instruction

1. Upload csv downloaded from yandex webmaster's page ~"top queries"
2. Rename file to 'input.csv'put in folder with files
3. Run scripts in order 1 -> 1-1 etc, -> 2 -> 2-1 etc. and see results, update and make yandex search better
4. you can make init.py and run it linearly from this, but do not lose control, there were a lot of my mistakes

* NOTE: it is not working that perfectly, required updates
